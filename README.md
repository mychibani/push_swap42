## Push Swap Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective
Push Swap project is an exploration of sorting algorithms, challenging developpers to sort data in two stacks with a limited set of instructions, aiming for the minimum number of operations.

### 📚 Description
- **Two Stacks:** Utilizes two stacks, `a` and `b`, manipulating a set of non-duplicate integers.
- **Limited Instructions:** Involves using predefined operations to swap, shift, and sort elements between the stacks.
- **Optimization Goal:** To sort the numbers in stack `a` in ascending order with the fewest operations possible.

### 🛠️ Skills Developed
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Efficient algorithm selection and implementation for data sorting.
- **Data Structures:** Advanced stack manipulation.
- **Code Optimization:** Techniques to minimize algorithmic complexity and operations.
- **C Programming:** Applying C programming principles for performance and maintainability.

### 📈 Results
Successfully sorted 100 numbers with <700 operations and 500 numbers with <5500 operations, showcasing deep algorithmic optimization understanding.

### 🚀 Impact
This project underscores the significance of selecting appropriate algorithms and optimization strategies for efficient complex sorting problem resolution. It marks a significant step in mastering data structures and programming optimization techniques.
